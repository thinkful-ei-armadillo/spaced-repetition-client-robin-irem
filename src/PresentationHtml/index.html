            <div>
            <p>♠Spanish is a fullstack app, optimized with computer science.</p>
            <p>♠Spanish helps users learn Spanish easily with spaced repetition learning technique.</p>

          <h3>How Does it work?</h3>
          <p>The app requires a user to register for an account. Afterwards, when they sign up, the user accesses the dashboard where a list of words appear.</p>
          <p>The users can see their progress by skimming the dashboard quickly, taking all the correct and incorrect past practices</p>
          <p>If they choose to start practicing, the app would simply provide whereever they left with their practice.</p>
          <p>The algorithm would give them the needed word for the correct implementation of spaced repetition technique.</p>
          <p>The most challenging part of learning a language is repetition and retaining new vocabulary.</p>
          <p>♠Spanish helps users pratice without flashcards and in the way that they will retain their newly acquired vocabulary for a lifetime!</p>

            <h3>Why Us</h3>
            <div class='imagedBox'>
            <div>
              <p>♠Spanish makes use of the spaced repetition techniques, known for its positive outcomes especially learning a large number of new items, such as vocabulary. </p>
              <p>It implements the technique by using a data structure (singly linked list).</p>
              <p>User can concentrate solely on words because of ♠Spanish's simple design and soft colors!</p>

          <h3> Reflection:</h3>
          <div class="reversedImagedBox">
            <div>
              <p>For once, we truly did a test driven development. We needed to design and develop accordingly in order to comply with the given tests.</p>
              <p>Separation of tasks help manage the project better.</p>
              <p>Still, pair programming adds the greatest value to a project as partners can use their different areas of strengths to further the project.</p>
              <p>We could, maybe, improve the project by keeping track of each issue on our kanban board.</p>
              <p>Implementation of DSA into a fullstack project is both challenging yet rewarding</p>
              <p> Next steps: it would be nice to have images and audio features for each word as that would tap to other ways of learning too.</p>
